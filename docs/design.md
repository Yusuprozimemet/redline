# Redline design

Redline is a spec-driven, test-first development tool. Its core rule is that **a requirement isn't
real until a test has proved it can fail.**

It combines the lightweight, tool-agnostic spec layer of
[OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) (living behaviour specs that grow through
`ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED` deltas, written as Given/When/Then scenarios) with the discipline of the
migration engine (`../migration-engine`): `new`/`hold` criteria, checks broken on purpose, frozen
safety-net tests, independent auditors, evidence-backed closes, 400-line PRs and one session per
step. The new part is that **test-first is checked mechanically**, by CI and git history, instead
of being taken on the agent's word.

## 1. What goes wrong, and the mechanism against each

| What goes wrong | Source | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| The spec rests on a wrong premise | Most common defect cause in the engine (455 of its 475 defects were the agent's own) | Premises with `file:line` citations, checked by the auditor and CI |
| A check that can't fail | Engine | CI proves red (a strict expected failure on `main`); mutation proves `hold` |
| The agent claims test-first without doing it | OpenSpec trusts the agent | Evidence comes from CI, never from the agent |
| The agent reviews its own work and misses its own errors | Engine | Independent read-only auditor, always |
| PRs too big to review | Engine (the gate forced splits 46 times) | 400-line gate, always |
| Context bloat and drift | Engine (64% of tokens were read after a session passed 300k) | One session per step, always, with a generated brief |
| Gaps where work is handed between steps | Engine | Every deferred item gets an ID and an owning step; CI fails on any item without one |
| Safety-net tests weakened quietly | Engine | Frozen tests locked by hash; an edit needs a departure a person approves |
| Specs drift away from the code | OpenSpec | Every scenario is linked to a test, checked both ways |
| Verify can be ignored | OpenSpec | Verify blocks archiving and merging |

## 2. Seven invariants (always on, at every rigor level)

1. **The spec comes before the code.** No code PR exists without a merged spec for it.
2. **Red before green, proved on `main`.** A test for a `new` scenario lands as a *strict expected
   failure*, and CI confirms it really fails.
3. **Every PR is ≤ 400 changed lines.** Specs and tests count; lockfiles and generated files
   (declared in config) don't. An `Oversized: <reason>` line needs a person's approval label.
4. **One session per step.** A step is one PR. A merge ends the session.
5. **An independent audit before code.** A read-only agent in a fresh context, on the strongest
   model. If that model isn't available, the work stops; it never falls back to a weaker one.
6. **The CLI observes; the agent never certifies.** Evidence is whatever CI ran.
7. **Nothing is silent.** Every departure, waiver or deferral is a recorded line with an owner.

A scenario:

```markdown
#### Scenario AUTH.2FA.S1 [new]: wrong code is rejected
- GIVEN a user with 2FA enrolled
- WHEN they submit an incorrect code
- THEN login fails AND no session is created
```

Premises:

```markdown
### Premises
- P1: Login issues a session in `auth/session.py:42` (`create_session`)
- P2: There is no 2FA check before `create_session` — `auth/login.py:18-35`
```

A citation is a backquoted `file:line` or `file:first-last` from the repository root, optionally
followed by a symbol in brackets. `redline check-premises` checks that the file exists, the lines
are within it, and the symbol is on them; a premise with no citation fails too.

Audit findings, written by the auditor only (closing a finding is a re-audit, never the main
session's word); a waiver names the person who approved it:

```markdown
## F1 [open]: P2 is wrong; `auth/login.py:30` already calls `verify_code`
## F2 [closed]: P1 cited the wrong line
Resolution: P1 now cites `auth/session.py:42`
## F3 [waived]: no test for the lockout timing
Waived-by: @maintainer: timing is a manual check (O2)
```

`pr` at S refuses if `audit.md` is missing, or any finding is `[open]`, a `[closed]` one has no
`Resolution:` or a `[waived]` one has no `Waived-by:`.

A test is linked to its scenario with a marker, e.g. `@pytest.mark.spec("AUTH.2FA.S1")`.

Steps, in order, with the scenarios each owns and the deferred items each step owns:

```markdown
## G1: Reject a wrong 2FA code
Owns: AUTH.2FA.S1

## Open items
- O1 [G2]: rate-limit repeated wrong codes
```

A step is named `<change>/<step>` (e.g. `add-2fa/G1`). It counts as merged on `main` when a commit
reachable from `main` carries the trailer `Redline-Step: add-2fa/G1`.

The ledger has one entry for each scenario the change's deltas declare:

```yaml
change: add-2fa
scenarios:
  AUTH.2FA.S1:
    red: {commit: 1a2b3c…, merged: 4d5e6f…, result: pass}
    green: null
    break: null
```

`red` is check-order's red commit (where the test's marker has `new=True`; once there is a green,
it is the red commit that is an ancestor of green), and `green` is the commit where `new` was
removed. `merged` is the first commit on `main`'s first-parent line that contains `commit`, which
is the commit CI ran on after the merge. `result` is that run's outcome: `pass`, `fail`, or
`unverified` when no result is recorded. `break` is the mutation result for `hold` scenarios and
stays `null` until step 5.

`redline ledger <change>` rebuilds the ledger from `main`'s history and writes it.
`redline check-ledger <change>` rebuilds it and fails if the committed file is missing or
differs. Only commits reachable from `main` count. So a step's PR carries the evidence of the
steps merged before it, never of its own commits: `pr` changes their hashes when it adds
trailers, and CI hasn't run on them after a merge. By the C step, the ledger holds every
scenario's red and green.

From git alone, the rebuild knows which commits made each scenario red and green, and where they
merged. It can't know whether the tests really failed or passed there. Only a CI run can say
that. After a run on a merged commit, CI records the outcome as a git note on that commit under
`refs/notes/redline-ci` (`result: pass` or `result: fail`, then `run: <url>`), and the rebuild
reads that note. Until the note exists, the result is `unverified`. Once it lands, the committed
ledger is stale, and the next step's PR refreshes it. A note is only as trustworthy as the people
who can push to `refs/notes/redline-ci`, because branch protection doesn't cover that ref.

## 5. A change is always the same sequence of steps

| Step | PR contents | CI proves |
|---|---|---|
| **S: Spec** | Proposal and delta spec, with audit findings resolved | Structure is valid, every premise citation resolves, IDs are unique, every finding is closed or waived |
| **R: Red** | Linked tests: `new` as strict expected failures (`xfail(strict=True)`, Jest `test.failing`); `hold` added to the lock | Every `new` test fails on today's code; every `hold` test passes, then fails under mutation |
| **G1…Gn: Green** | Code that turns expected failures into passes | Owned scenarios pass with their markers removed, the lock is unchanged, nothing else regressed |
| **C: Close** | Verify report, delta merged into `specs/`, defect log, deferred items with owners | Every scenario has red, break (for `hold`) and green results from merged commits, and the red commit is an ancestor of the green one |

Red tests can merge onto `main` while CI stays green, because CI expects them to fail. A `new` test
that passes before the code exists turns CI red under strict expected-failure, so a check that
can't fail can't get in. Git history then records test-first as fact.

At **lite** rigor, S and R may share one PR, so the smallest change is two sessions.

## 6. Session protocol

```
redline start <step>   refuses unless the previous step is merged on main, the branch is fresh
                       from main, and no other step is open in this session (hook-enforced where
                       the AI tool allows) → prints the step brief
redline pr             runs the local gates (lines, lock, red/green), opens the PR, ends the step
redline merged         confirms the merge via git, syncs main, refreshes status, prints the
                       hand-off prompt for the next step → stop
```

`pr` runs check-lines always, check-premises and check-audit at S (on the step's own change: an
older change's premises may go stale as the code moves on), and check-links and check-order from
the R step on (at S the delta's scenarios have no tests yet). Only when every gate passes does it put the
`Redline-Step` trailer on each of the step's commits (once), push, and open the PR with `gh`.

`merged <step>` fetches and fast-forwards local `main` first, then looks for the step's trailer on
`main` and refuses if it isn't there. Once it is, it switches to `main` (the next step starts fresh
from it, so uncommitted changes refuse before anything syncs), clears the open-step record if the
step it names is merged, and prints the next step's brief, or that the change is complete after C.

The brief (goal, owned scenario IDs, cited files, open items) is generated from the spec, the
ledger and the open items. It's the whole hand-off: a new session needs nothing from the old one.

## 7. Trust model

| Source | Counts as evidence? |
|---|---|
| CI run on a merged commit | Yes, and only this |
| CLI run locally | A preview, which CI re-runs |
| The agent's report or summary | Never |
| `ledger.yaml` | A cache, which CI rebuilds from history |

## 8. Rigor levels (on top of the invariants)

| Level | Adds |
|---|---|
| **lite** | Nothing; S and R may share one PR |
| **standard** (default) | Mutation testing on the touched files, and a defect log |
| **critical** | Frozen contract lock (timing included), one track per Green PR, a plan-auditor at the start and end of each phase, blind relabelling of defects, independent end-of-initiative auditors |

The proposal declares its level. The auditor may raise it (auth, payments, data migrations,
public APIs are critical) but never lower it.

## 9. Roles

| Role | Model | Can |
|---|---|---|
| Maintainer (a person) | — | Merge; approve waivers, departures, `Oversized` |
| Main session | Strong | Specs, briefs, review, breaks, PRs |
| Auditor | Strongest, fresh context | Read and report only |
| Implementer | Cheaper | Code from a brief; never commits |

The CLI holds the rules; each AI tool gets thin skills or commands, as in OpenSpec.

For Claude Code the auditor is `.claude/agents/redline-auditor.md`: tools `Read, Grep, Glob` only,
`model: fable`, and it refuses on any other model rather than run on a weaker one. Claude Code
can't limit Write to one file, so the auditor stays read-only and replies with the whole
`audit.md`, which the main session writes unedited. A re-run reads the old `audit.md`, keeps
every finding and closes only what it has checked. The `Waived-by:` line is the maintainer's.

## 10. Learning loop

`redline retro` at each close groups the change's defects by cause and proposes rule changes to
`redline/config.yaml`, each as a normal small PR.

## 11. Build order (riskiest first)

1. **Red/green proof**: pytest plugin with `spec` markers and strict expected failures, plus the
   git-ancestry check (red commit is an ancestor of green). If this doesn't feel natural, the
   design changes.
2. 400-line gate; scenario-to-test linking both ways; `start`/`pr`/`merged` and the brief.
3. Premise citations and the auditor agent.
4. Ledger rebuilt by CI; GitHub Action.
5. Mutation (mutmut, then Stryker, PIT); contract lock; critical level.
6. Initiatives and plans; `retro`.

## 12. Open problems

- Scenarios that can't be automated (visual, timing): a recorded manual check with a reason,
  which the auditor may challenge.
- Mutation cost on large codebases: touched files only, at the Red step only.
- Whether a test asserts its scenario's THEN clauses is a judgment; the auditor checks it.
